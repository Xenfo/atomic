## What is Atomic

Atomic is a chat app that I am working on. It supposed to be a lot like Discord which we all know and love, the only difference being that it's open sourced. 

## Contribution

Atomic is open to contributions, but I recommend opening an issue 

Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for details on this project.

## License

Atomic is [MIT licesed](/LICENSE).
