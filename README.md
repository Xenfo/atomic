## What is Atomic

Atomic is a chat app that I am working on. It supposed to be a lot like Discord which we all know and love, the only difference being that it's open sourced. 

## Contribution

Atomic is open to contributions, but I recommend opening an issue on GitHub with your idea before implementing it so that you can receive feedback.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to this project.

## License

Atomic is [MIT licensed](/LICENSE).
