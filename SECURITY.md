## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in the app please open an issue with 
[this](https://github.com/Xenfo/atomic/issues/new?assignees=Xenfo&labels=bug%2C+security&template=security-vulnerability.md&title=%5BSECURITY%5D+)
template or contact me on Discord at Xenfo#0001.

Once a vulnerability is reported, maintainers will investigate and take action on it. If a maintainer cannot 
replicate the vulnerability, the issue will be closed. If the issue is accepted there will be a security patch immediatly or the patch 
will be added to the next version of Atomic depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
